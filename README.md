# Data Structures Toy Library

This toy Java library is for the sake of practice with core data structures and their associated algorithms. It is completely self-contained with no dependency (except JUnit for testing).

This library is influenced by, but does not rely on, the standard java.util collections. It also includes some additonal features, such as elements in 'lists' can be accessed with negative indices (similar to how they are used in Python), and the main Dictionary class will be iterable, unlike Java's Map.

Each data structure is accompanied by its own unit tests to ensure it is working as expected.

Thanks for reading!

Note: this library is not intended for use by serious projects!
